# Backport release artifacts from main to dev after a release tag publishes.
#
# Writes the released version into every version carrier the repo has and
# copies CHANGELOG.md from main, then lands them via a PR against dev (per
# this repo's PR-only convention: direct commits to dev are not permitted).
#   - Version carriers, each updated in place when present: the release
#     package's Cargo.toml (the workspace member that builds the binary when
#     the root manifest is virtual, `RELEASE_MANIFEST`; the root otherwise),
#     package.json, pyproject.toml, VERSION (plain text, no leading "v").
#   - Cargo.lock, whose workspace-member entries are refreshed from the synced
#     manifests once every other path is in, and checked with `--locked`.
#   - CHANGELOG.md, copied verbatim from origin/main when main carries one.
#     Main is fully authoritative for CHANGELOG; dev never edits it directly.
#   - Every other path main and dev disagree about, discovered rather than
#     listed. A release branch is edited for reasons nobody predicts (a doc
#     fix, a reverted payload, a deleted config), and each such edit is made
#     against main's base and never round-trips. A fixed list misses all of
#     them silently, and the next release's overlay or cherry-pick then
#     restores dev's copy over main's, undoing the edit.
#
# Discovery is bounded by the PREVIOUS release tag, the last point the two
# branches agreed, so widening the copy cannot revert dev's unreleased work:
#
#   release-prep  dev's copy is byte-identical to the previous tag's, so dev
#                 never touched it and main's version is purely release-prep.
#                 Adopted automatically.
#   contested     both sides moved since the previous tag. Reported, never
#                 adopted silently; --include-contested takes them all and
#                 --only PATH takes the ones you name.
#
# Guarded paths are excluded: they live on dev by design, so "syncing" them
# would delete them. The set resolves from scripts/release/guarded-paths.sh
# when the repo vendors it, never a second hand-kept copy.
#
# Run AFTER:
#   1. The release/v* -> main PR has merged.
#   2. `git tag -a vX.Y.Z` has been pushed to origin.
#   3. The GitHub Release has been created.
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/sync-dev-after-release.sh v0.2.0
#   ./scripts/sync-dev-after-release.sh v0.2.0 --dry-run
#   ./scripts/sync-dev-after-release.sh v0.2.0 --only README.md
#   ./scripts/sync-dev-after-release.sh v0.2.0 --include-contested
#
# Idempotent: safe to re-run. If dev already matches main on every synced

## Summary

Backports the v${VERSION_NO_V} release-prep state from \`main\` so dev's version carriers match the released
number and the v${VERSION_NO_V} CHANGELOG section sits at the top of dev's \`CHANGELOG.md\` going forward.

Source: tag \`${VERSION}\` at \`${TAG_SHORT}\` on \`main\`. Files synced: ${SYNC_LIST}.

Generated by \`scripts/sync-dev-after-release.sh\`. Run idempotently per release: if dev already matches main on
these files, the script exits 0 without creating this PR.

## Changelog

This PR is producer-side scaffolding and does not change anything users see; no \`## Changelog\` bullets to
extract.

## Type of Change

- [x] \`chore\`: Maintenance tasks (release backport)

## Related Issues/Stories

- Story: n/a
- Issue: n/a
- Architecture: n/a
- Related PRs: the release/${VERSION} PR into main

## Testing

- [x] Manual testing completed

The script's preflight verified: the release tag exists, \`origin/main\` is at or past it, and the GitHub Release
is not still a draft. \`generate-changelog.py --dry-run\` was also invoked post-sync to check for PR-body drift
against the backported CHANGELOG; see this PR's stderr for any drift warnings.
